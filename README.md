# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I build the front-end portion of websites and web applicationsâ€”the part users see and interact with. As a front-end developer, I creates websites and applications using web languages such as `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. To serve as a support or guide for creating user interfaces more efficiently, I use frameworks like: `react.js`, `tailwindcss` and a little bit of `vue.js`. As an alternative way to write CSS code, I use `Sass` also known as `Scss` to introduce new features like variables, mixins, nested rules, and mathematical operations, which allow developers to create modular, efficient, and reusable code.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work with back-end technologies like: `php` and `mySql`
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with designers, Backend Developers, and other team members to ensure the websites or apps works and meets the project goals.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to send an email to nathancodes05@gmail.com to collaborate on amazing project ideas.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The hobby I could never give up is writting codes.
